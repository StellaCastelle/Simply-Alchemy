Simply Alchemy
==============

Simply Alchemy is a Minecraft NeoForge Mod based around the combination of alchemy and magic with the purpose of achieving a greater
Modern Alchemy Mastery in order to be able to create better machines that are needed to create more advanced gear. That gear is going
to be of great help when eventually facing bosses in a custom Dungeon Dimension with Bosses and Mobs that play in a completely
different League than Vanilla Minecraft Mobs ;3
The Mod will introduce a custom Profession for the Player, together with a Profession Leveling System, as well as new Blocks, Trees,
Machines, Weapons and more. Ir also will introdce a Enchantment System different from the Vanilla one, allowing for more Freedom and
less RNG when looking for enchants. Depending on the Proffesion Mastery the Player will also be able to imbue Armor and Items with
Attributes, using a specific Tool (mid- to endgame), as well as Mana and Resources. For that there will be a Multiblock Structure, the
Forge.
