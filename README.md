Simply Alchemy
==============

Simply Alchemy is a Minecraft NeoForge Mod based around the combination of alchemy and magic with the purpose of achieving a greater
Modern Alchemy Mastery in order to be able to create better machines that are needed to create more advanced gear. That gear is going
to be of great help when eventually facing bosses in a custom Dungeon Dimension with Bosses and Mobs that play in a completely
different League than Vanilla Minecraft Mobs ;3
The Mod will introduce a custom Profession for the Player, together with a Profession Leveling System, as well as new Blocks, Trees,
Machines, Weapons and more. It also will introduce an Enchantment System different from the Vanilla one, allowing for more Freedom and
less RNG when looking for enchants. Depending on the Proffesion Mastery, the Player will also be able to imbue Armor and Items with
Attributes using a specific Tool (mid- to endgame), as well as Mana and Resources. For that there will be a Multiblock Structure, the
Alchemical Forge.

Lore:
=====

The Alchemists are a group of people that used to belong to a very advanced Civilisation. Due to differences in their ideology, they
were disliked by other nations and were eventually, after a 100 year long war, defeated, their records burned and long forgotten. You,
the Player, stumbled, hundreds of years after the Grand War, upon a book called 'The Basics of Alchemy', written by an author whose name
was inrecognisable. You got the book from a trader that wanted to throw the book away. The book is a part of the lost Alchemy Records,
also knows as 'Laplace Fragments', a not quite infinite collection of knowledge, usefull and possibly dangerous, created by the renowed
5 Alchemy Grandmasters. The choice is yours - will you read this book and dip your toes in the grand sea of opportunities, or will you
avoid it and choose a different path?...
